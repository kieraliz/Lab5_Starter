Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

1. No, unit tests run locally so I can't verify if a message has been sent to another user.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test with more than the max message length to verify that my application produces the expected outcome.
